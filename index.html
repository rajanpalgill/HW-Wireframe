		<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
		<p>My name is Rajanpal Gill and I enjoy learning new things most of the time it's about pointless stuff but I also enjoy sports like Basketball, Football or it may be some tennis. The reason I took this program was because I am entrigued by technology and the things you can create with knowing how to code. I want to create a app thats like tinder but just for dogs and you can only swipe right.</p>
